            Sentry and Hulk are the most powerful avengers in the comics.
            <br>
            The original Avengers team is done. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) first teamed up in 2012's Avengers.

            They are called Avengers because the exact purpose of the group is to avenge. And avenge what, you ask? Well, whatever needs to be avenged, clearly! Only when there is a wrong to avenge, and it's a wrong that cannot be fought by a single hero, the Avengers assemble.

            Their leader or the main avenger is Captain america.
